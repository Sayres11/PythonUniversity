Reads student data from a file, including email, first name, last name, and the number of points obtained in the "Introduction to Python Programming" course. Additionally, the file may contain data about the final grade and status ('', GRADED, MAILED) on the same line. Assume that the file exists and may be empty or contain basic information: email, first name, last name, points. Use a dictionary with nested structures to store the data.
Allows automatic grading for all students who do not have a grade assigned yet (status different from GRADED and MAILED), according to the grading scale proposed in the course's regulations.
Enables manual addition and removal of students (checking if the email is already taken).
Allows sending an email with the assigned grade to all students with a status other than MAILED.
Ensures that any change made, such as adding/removing student data, sending an email, or assigning a grade, is also saved in the file.

Assignment 1: you need to implement a sorted, singly linked list called MyLinkedList using the Element class. The class should have methods for string representation, getting an element, deleting an element, and appending elements while maintaining the sorting order.

Assignment 2: you are required to modify the previous exercise to use the Student and MySortedList classes. The grading should follow specific rules based on project scores, task list scores, and homework averages. You also need to enhance the email functionality to allow for specifying a new status and determining the statuses for which an email should be sent.
